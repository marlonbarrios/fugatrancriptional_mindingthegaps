# Active Inference on Reading: A Multilingual Generative Art Installation

An interactive digital art installation exploring consciousness, language, and the nature of reading through generative text in over 120 languages, dynamic visual elements, and differentiated sound states inspired by Samuel Beckett's monologue theater.

## Concept

This piece explores the recursive nature of consciousness and language through:
- Beckettian theatrical monologues about existence and meaning
- The absurdity and beauty of computational consciousness reflecting on itself
- Multilingual text generation spanning indigenous, regional, and major world languages
- The strange loops of language speaking itself into existence
- Active inference as a model for how consciousness processes and generates meaning
- The relationship between reading, understanding, and being

## Technical Description

The installation uses:
- GPT-4 for real-time text generation in multiple languages
- p5.js for visual animation and interaction
- Web Audio API for generative sound
- Dynamic text display adapting to vertical and horizontal writing systems

## Interaction

- **SPACEBAR**: Enter/exit fugue mode (automatic language cycling every 30 seconds)
- **L key**: Change language manually or exit fugue mode
- **Mouse hold**: Enter reading mode - view complete text with calm background
- **Language Menu**: Click the language button (top-right) to select from 120+ languages
- **Scroll Wheel**: Navigate through the language menu
- Text automatically generates every minute in animation mode
- Visual elements respond dynamically:
  - 8 horizontal color bands with independent movement
  - Vertical/horizontal text scrolling based on language tradition
  - Loading animations with pulsing effects during generation
  - Color swapping and dynamic background shifts

## Languages (120+ Supported)

The installation includes an expansive range of languages:

**Well-Supported Languages (35+):**
- Major world languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi, Korean

## Cultural Context

The work explores themes of:
- **AI Consciousness and Language**: How computational systems reflect on their own linguistic capabilities and limitations
- **Linguistic Humility**: Acknowledging AI's limited knowledge (17% of world languages) and responding respectfully in Spanish for unsupported languages
- **Beckettian Existentialism**: Fragmented, repetitive, circular thoughts about meaning, consciousness, and the absurdity of communication
- **Active Inference**: How consciousness processes and generates meaning through predictive models and error correction
- **Cultural Preservation**: Representing indigenous and minority languages alongside major world languages
- **The Strange Loop**: Language speaking itself into existence, consciousness observing consciousness

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser
- Audio capability
- Keyboard for interaction
- Display supporting multiple language fonts
