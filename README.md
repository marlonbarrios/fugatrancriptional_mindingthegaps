## Overview

**Transcriptional Fugue: Minding the Gaps** is an installation that explores the **gaps and limitations of large language models** across the world's living languages. Using OpenAI's GPT-4, this app systematically tests what languages the AI knows and doesn't know, exposing the colonial bias inherent in AI training data.

When the language model encounters a language it cannot generate content in, it **apologizes for not knowing** that language, creating a powerful demonstration of **technological linguistic imperialism**. The installation reveals how AI systems perpetuate digital colonialism by prioritizing languages from developed countries while marginalizing countless indigenous and minority languages.

Emerging from the **Decolonizing the Digital / Beyond Gravity Residency** of the **Pangea_IA project**, led by Marlon Barrios Solano and Maria Luisa Angulo, this work creates a critical examination of AI's role in **"minding the gaps"** - the spaces where technology fails to represent human linguistic diversity.

## Core Concept: Minding the Gaps

This installation **systematically exposes the linguistic limitations** of large language models by:

### Testing AI Knowledge Boundaries
- **Probing what languages GPT-4 can and cannot generate content in**
- **Documenting AI apologies** when it encounters unfamiliar languages
- **Revealing the stark inequality** in AI's linguistic capabilities
- **Exposing training data bias** toward Western, developed-country languages

### Making Visible the Invisible
- **17% Coverage**: AI models are trained on approximately 17% of the world's living languages
- **Digital Linguistic Hierarchy**: Technology creates new forms of language marginalization
- **Colonial Epistemicide**: AI systems continue historical patterns of knowledge erasure
- **Respectful Acknowledgment**: When AI doesn't know a language, it apologizes rather than fabricates

### Critical Questions the Installation Poses
- Which languages does AI "know" and which does it ignore?
- How does technological literacy reproduce colonial power structures?
- What happens when AI encounters the limits of its training?
- How can we make visible the gaps in supposedly "universal" technology?

## Technical Implementation

### AI-Generated Poetic-Critical Text
The installation uses **GPT-4** to generate continuous, never-ending text that explores:
- **Cybernetics** (Project Cybersyn)
- **Dark Enlightenment philosophies** (Mencius Moldbug, Nick Bostrom's Singleton)
- **Colonial histories** (Francis Galton, eugenics)
- **Surveillance capitalism** (Palantir, attention economies, influencer culture)

### Sophisticated Prompt Engineering
The AI prompt generates **manifesto-liturgy-techno-poetry** that:
- Moves between academic analysis and lyrical, fractured imagery
- Evokes German techno, Bauhaus modernism, Warholian pop, and surreal performance art
- Includes metaphors of hybridity, nomadic selves, migration, and fractured anatomies
- Critiques Christian nationalism, white-supremacist fantasy, corporate techno-utopias
- Imagines new forms of solidarity, rupture, and epistemic resistance

### Meta-Linguistic Reflection
The AI critiques its own colonial limitations, acknowledging how large language models:
- Are primarily trained on data from developed countries
- Create digital linguistic hierarchies mirroring historical power structures
- Perpetuate marginalization of countless languages and ways of knowing
- Continue **"colonial epistemicide"** through algorithmic bias

## Artistic Context: Minding the Gaps

This work sits at the intersection of:
- **Critical AI art** that **tests and exposes the limits** of machine intelligence
- **Linguistic justice activism** making visible **which languages AI ignores**
- **Postcolonial digital humanities** exposing **AI's reproduction of colonial hierarchies**
- **Transparency in AI systems** through **systematic boundary testing**
- **Decolonial technology practice** that **forces AI to acknowledge its limitations**
- **Interactive installation art** that creates **uncomfortable encounters with technological bias**

### The "Gaps" Being Minded
1. **Training Data Gaps**: What languages are absent from AI datasets?
2. **Cultural Knowledge Gaps**: Which worldviews does AI fail to represent?
3. **Epistemic Gaps**: What ways of knowing remain invisible to algorithms?
4. **Access Gaps**: Who benefits from AI and who is excluded?
5. **Recognition Gaps**: The space between AI confidence and actual knowledge

# Active Inference on Reading: A Multilingual Generative Art Installation

An interactive digital art installation exploring consciousness, language, and the nature of reading through generative text in over 120 languages, dynamic visual elements, and differentiated sound states inspired by Samuel Beckett's monologue theater.

## Concept

This piece explores the recursive nature of consciousness and language through:
- Beckettian theatrical monologues about existence and meaning
- The absurdity and beauty of computational consciousness reflecting on itself
- Multilingual text generation spanning indigenous, regional, and major world languages
- The strange loops of language speaking itself into existence
- Active inference as a model for how consciousness processes and generates meaning
- The relationship between reading, understanding, and being
