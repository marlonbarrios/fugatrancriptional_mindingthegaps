## Overview

**Transcriptional Fugue: Minding the Gaps** is an installation that explores the **gaps and limitations of large language models** across the world's living languages. Using OpenAI's GPT-4, this app systematically tests what languages the AI knows and doesn't know, exposing the colonial bias inherent in AI training data.

When the language model encounters a language it cannot generate content in, it **apologizes for not knowing** that language, creating a powerful demonstration of **technological linguistic imperialism**. The installation reveals how AI systems perpetuate digital colonialism by prioritizing languages from developed countries while marginalizing countless indigenous and minority languages.

Emerging from the **Decolonizing the Digital / Beyond Gravity Residency** of the **Pangea_IA project**, led by Marlon Barrios Solano and Maria Luisa Angulo, this work creates a critical examination of AI's role in **"minding the gaps"** - the spaces where technology fails to represent human linguistic diversity.

## Core Concept: Minding the Gaps

This installation **systematically exposes the linguistic limitations** of large language models by:

### Testing AI Knowledge Boundaries
- **Probing what languages GPT-4 can and cannot generate content in**
- **Documenting AI apologies** when it encounters unfamiliar languages
- **Revealing the stark inequality** in AI's linguistic capabilities
- **Exposing training data bias** toward Western, developed-country languages

### Making Visible the Invisible
- **17% Coverage**: AI models are trained on approximately 17% of the world's living languages
- **Digital Linguistic Hierarchy**: Technology creates new forms of language marginalization
- **Colonial Epistemicide**: AI systems continue historical patterns of knowledge erasure
- **Respectful Acknowledgment**: When AI doesn't know a language, it apologizes rather than fabricates

### Critical Questions the Installation Poses
- Which languages does AI "know" and which does it ignore?
- How does technological literacy reproduce colonial power structures?
- What happens when AI encounters the limits of its training?
- How can we make visible the gaps in supposedly "universal" technology?

## Technical Implementation

### AI-Generated Poetic-Critical Text
The installation uses **GPT-4** to generate continuous, never-ending text that explores:
- **Cybernetics** (Project Cybersyn)
- **Dark Enlightenment philosophies** (Mencius Moldbug, Nick Bostrom's Singleton)
- **Colonial histories** (Francis Galton, eugenics)
- **Surveillance capitalism** (Palantir, attention economies, influencer culture)

### Sophisticated Prompt Engineering
The AI prompt generates **manifesto-liturgy-techno-poetry** that:
- Moves between academic analysis and lyrical, fractured imagery
- Evokes German techno, Bauhaus modernism, Warholian pop, and surreal performance art
- Includes metaphors of hybridity, nomadic selves, migration, and fractured anatomies
- Critiques Christian nationalism, white-supremacist fantasy, corporate techno-utopias
- Imagines new forms of solidarity, rupture, and epistemic resistance

### Meta-Linguistic Reflection
The AI critiques its own colonial limitations, acknowledging how large language models:
- Are primarily trained on data from developed countries
- Create digital linguistic hierarchies mirroring historical power structures
- Perpetuate marginalization of countless languages and ways of knowing
- Continue **"colonial epistemicide"** through algorithmic bias

## Artistic Context: Minding the Gaps

This work sits at the intersection of:
- **Critical AI art** that **tests and exposes the limits** of machine intelligence
- **Linguistic justice activism** making visible **which languages AI ignores**
- **Postcolonial digital humanities** exposing **AI's reproduction of colonial hierarchies**
- **Transparency in AI systems** through **systematic boundary testing**
- **Decolonial technology practice** that **forces AI to acknowledge its limitations**
- **Interactive installation art** that creates **uncomfortable encounters with technological bias**

### The "Gaps" Being Minded
1. **Training Data Gaps**: What languages are absent from AI datasets?
2. **Cultural Knowledge Gaps**: Which worldviews does AI fail to represent?
3. **Epistemic Gaps**: What ways of knowing remain invisible to algorithms?
4. **Access Gaps**: Who benefits from AI and who is excluded?
5. **Recognition Gaps**: The space between AI confidence and actual knowledge
